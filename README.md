# Background

I am a researcher and lecturer in spatial cognition - a branch of cognitive science studying how people think *about*, think *in*, and think *with* space.

I am a psychologist by training and I apply psychological methods in the fields of geoinformatics, architecture, and human-computer interaction.

## Wayfinding Through Orientation
![WayTO Project](/images/wayto.png)

Traditional wayfinding devices use turn-by-turn instructions such as 'turn left' or 'continue for 300 m'. These are easy to follow but leave us disoriented. They don’t correspond to how we would describe any route to other people. Can different types of navigation instructions help us learn the new environment *while* we navigate it?

## Eye-Tracking and Spatial Layouts of Art Galleries
![Art Galleries PhD Project](/images/artgalleries.jpg)

Art galleries are a very unique type of space: white, empty walls and the art itself are almost the only visual stimuli around. In such a situation, their spatial layout (the spatial arrangement of artworks and rooms) is what really steers the visitors’ attention.

## Architectural Cognition
![Architectural Cognition](/images/arch.jpg)

I am interested in how psychology can aid architecture in improving the usability of buildings. I study how space 'guides' our behaviour, our attention, and our thinking. I extensively use Mobile Eye-Tracking technology and the theory of Space Syntax.
