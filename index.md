## Bio

I am a researcher and lecturer in spatial cognition - a branch of cognitive science studying how people think *about*, think *in*, and think *with* space.

My background and approach are interdisciplinary, with MA in psychology, PhD from a department of architecture, and postdoc experience in geoinformatics. I apply cognitive psychology methods in the fields of geoinformatics, architecture, and human-computer interaction.

For selected projects, see below.

## Wayfinding Through Orientation

Traditional wayfinding devices use turn-by-turn instructions such as 'turn left' or 'continue for 300 m'. These are easy to follow but leave us disoriented. They don’t correspond to how we would describe any route to other people. Can different types of navigation instructions help us learn the environment *while* we navigate?

We designed a new type of navigation instructions and demonstrated that they improve what people learn about the broader enviornment (e.g., the entire city), without sacrificing their understanding of the current route.

## Spatial Layouts of Art Galleries

Art galleries are a very unique type of space: white, empty walls and the art itself are almost the only visual stimuli around. In such a situation, their spatial layout (the spatial arrangement of artworks and rooms) is what really steers the visitors’ attention.

![Art Galleries PhD Project](/images/artgalleries.jpg)

In my PhD project I demonstrated that the layout of space can have a larger impact on visitor's attention than the differences between individual artworks. I also showed that although the layout can change the strategy with which visitors attend to artworks, cumulative time spent on attending to each picture is unaffected by its location. Methodologically, the project combined Mobile Eye-Tracking with the architectural theory of Space Syntax.

## Architectural Cognition

I am interested in how psychology can aid architecture in improving the usability of buildings. I study how space 'guides' our behaviour, our attention, and our thinking. I design formal measures for architectural computation that are grounded in the cognitive experience of space.

![Architectural Cognition](/images/arch.jpg)

In recent work, we extended a popular architectural measure of visibility, called an "isovist", from 2-D to 3-D environments. We demonstrated that our measure better predicts how "spacious" and "complex" a building feels to a human occupant, compared to the previously available methods.

Key publications:

* ["Towards Embodied 3D Isovists"](pdfs/Krukar%2C%20Schultz%2C%20Bhatt%20-%202017%20-%20Towards%20Embodied%203D%20Isovists.pdf)

* ["Architectural Cognition and Behavior"](pdfs/Dalton%2C%20Krukar%2C%20Ho%CC%88lscher%20-%202018%20-%20Architectural%20cognition%20and%20behavior.pdf)
